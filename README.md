# levenberg-marquardt-method
Python implementation of Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm built from scratch using NumPy. Code adapted from Gavin, H.P. (2020), The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for nonlinear least squares curve-fitting problems.



How to Use:
Input raw data and initial guesses of parameter values into example_LM.py (contains main function)
Test data and inputs included for reference
Change model fitting equation in levenberg_marquardt.py via 'lm_func' function
